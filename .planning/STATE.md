## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases — Infra Portability first (unblocks cloud deploy), then Security (gates external users), then BrainSuite scoring (primary deliverable), then Dashboard + Reliability
- [Phase 2 flag]: BrainSuite API schema unknown — Phase 3 must start with an API discovery spike before finalizing DB schema or Angular types

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: BrainSuite API schema (dimension field names, score range, response envelope) is unknown — must do a live API discovery spike before committing to creative_score_results table schema or Angular DTO types
- [Phase 4]: UX score color thresholds depend on confirmed BrainSuite score scale from Phase 3
- [General]: Google Ads OAuth consent screen — verify "Published" status before Phase 4 (Testing mode = 7-day refresh token expiry in production)
