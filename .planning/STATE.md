# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** A user can connect all their ad accounts, see every creative's performance metrics alongside its BrainSuite effectiveness score, and immediately know which creatives to scale or kill.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Infrastructure Portability

Phase: 1 of 4 (Infrastructure Portability)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases — Infra Portability first (unblocks cloud deploy), then Security (gates external users), then BrainSuite scoring (primary deliverable), then Dashboard + Reliability
- [Phase 2 flag]: BrainSuite API schema unknown — Phase 3 must start with an API discovery spike before finalizing DB schema or Angular types

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: BrainSuite API schema (dimension field names, score range, response envelope) is unknown — must do a live API discovery spike before committing to creative_score_results table schema or Angular DTO types
- [Phase 4]: UX score color thresholds depend on confirmed BrainSuite score scale from Phase 3
- [General]: Google Ads OAuth consent screen — verify "Published" status before Phase 4 (Testing mode = 7-day refresh token expiry in production)
